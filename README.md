## PIPM Distribution Tool
PIPM is an all-in-one player metric, designed by Jonathan Goldstein. It measures a player's impact in net points per 100 possessions. In this project it is used as a target variable as proxy for quality/talent.

The distributions made from Random Forest Model are displayed [here] (https://www.thestepien.com/player-distribution-tool/).

## Blended Draft Model
A single number prediction model is also under construction, using several machine learning algorithms.
